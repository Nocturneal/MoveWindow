# MoveWindow
Small utility to automagically bring windows to the same screen as the utility.

The intended use case is for those who are using a remote desktop application (like VNC, AnyDesk, etc.) and need to interact with windows that are off-screen.
Often this can happen on remote (target) machines that are running multiple monitors.

Mostly I use this when running NVidia gamestream via Moonlight. (https://github.com/moonlight-stream)

Use is quite straightforward: Run the app, drag it to the intended movement point (all the windows will try to align to the app)
and select one or more windows you want to move.

Finally, just click "Bring me my windows!"
